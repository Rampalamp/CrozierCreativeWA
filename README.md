# CrozierCreativeWA

CrozierCreative with Blazor WebAssembly

Classic coding project that has been tossed to the side, most of the unknowns for the SNAKE game have been sorted out, just need to do the work.

Has a moving snake body setup in a JS render loop from a blazor application.

Need to sort out growing snake body, game, boundaries, apple/snake interaction, points/scoreboard.

Maybe one day...
